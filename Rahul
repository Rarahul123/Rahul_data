**Step 1: Data source**
- In this critical first step, you obtain a dataset containing historical housing data. The dataset should ideally include a wide range of features, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location details, amenities, year built, and sale prices. This data can be gathered from various sources, including public datasets, real estate websites, government records, and local real estate associations.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
- Data collected from different sources often requires cleaning and preparation. This involves addressing issues like missing values (e.g., filling them in with appropriate values), handling outliers (e.g., removing or transforming extreme data points), and encoding categorical variables (e.g., converting neighborhood names into numerical codes). Data preprocessing ensures that the data is in a consistent and usable format for machine learning.

**Step 3: Feature Selection**
- Choosing the right features is crucial for model performance. Domain knowledge and data analysis can help in selecting the most relevant features that influence house prices. Additionally, feature engineering may involve creating new features like price per square foot, property age, or neighborhood-specific indicators to improve prediction accuracy.



**Step 4: Model Selection **
- Selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithm is pivotal. Regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks are commonly used for house price prediction. The choice depends on factors like dataset size, complexity, and interpretability.

**Step 5: Model Training**
- The selected machine learning model is trained using the training dataset. During training, the model learns the relationships between the chosen features and house prices. It adjusts its parameters to minimize the prediction error.

**Step 6: Evaluation**
- After training, the model's performance is assessed using the test dataset. Regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared are used to measure how well the model's predictions match the actual house prices in the test set.
